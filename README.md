# Internship scripts, Jupyter notebooks and `csv` files
A collection of scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and `csv` files for my internship at Aarhus University. The goal of the project was to study the microbial community and potential interaction partners of [cable bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_bacteria).

## Scripts
1. `bin_quality_count.py` — return the number of bins above specified thresholds of completeness and contamination.
2. `extract_fasta.py` — filter sequences from a fasta file based on a list of input contig ids and generate a filtered output file.
3. `merge_quality_taxa_tables.py` — merge datasets with taxonomic and quality information.
4. `remove_duplicate_seq.py` — remove duplicate sequences (having the same id) from a FASTA file.

## Jupyter notebooks
1. `big_quality_tables.ipynb`
