# Internship Scripts and Jupyter notebooks
A collection of scripts and Jupyter notebooks for my internship at Aarhus University. The goal of the project was to study the microbial community and potential interaction partners of [cable bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_bacteria).

## Scripts
1. `bin_quality_count.py` - return the number of bins above specified thresholds of completeness and contamination.
2. `extract_fasta.py` - filter sequences from a fasta file based on a list of input contig ids and generate a filtered output file.
